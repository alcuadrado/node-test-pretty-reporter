## Usage

```sh
npm install -D @voxpelli/node-test-pretty-reporter
```

```sh
node --test --test-reporter=@voxpelli/node-test-pretty-reporter
```

## Why another test reporter?

This one is similar to the built-in `spec` reporter but differs in some ways which I personally prefer.

### Rendering diffs from assertions

Outputs colored diffs when a test is failed with an `Error` that has `expected` and `actual` properties (respecting a `showDiff` property set to `false`).

Diff is generated by [`jest-diff`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-diff) (no other part of `jest` is used in this reporter).

Assertion libraries that outputs compatible errors:
  * [`node:assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html#assert)
  * [`chai`](https://www.chaijs.com/)

As with other changes, this makes the reporter on par [with Mocha](https://mochajs.org/#diffs).

### Output styling

The output styling aligns more with Mocha's [`spec` reporter](https://mochajs.org/#spec):

* Errors are presented at the end instead of in the list of tests
* Less visually intense, eg. no `▶` in front of names and only failed tests gets colored
* Durations are only reported if considered slow (using same default [as Mocha](https://mochajs.org/#test-duration): 75ms)
* No redundant mentioning of a test suite after the suite has completed – opts for a clean tree from top to bottom instead

### _Planned:_ Outputting the full `cause` chain of an `Error`

Originally [a PR of mine to Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4829), my plan was to output the full `cause` chain in this reporter instead, but seems like the full `cause` chain is not available to the reporters, probably due to the reporter and the tests living in different processes. Will investigate further, follow in [issue #2](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-test-pretty-reporter/issues/2).


## Similar modules

I have not tested any of these myself yet so can't say if they work well or not, but adding here for reference.

* [`MoLow/reporters`](https://github.com/MoLow/reporters) – many custom reporters for `node:test`
* [`nearform/node-test-github-reporter`](https://github.com/nearform/node-test-github-reporter) – another custom report for `node:test`, this one from [@nearform](https://github.com/nearform) and geared towards GitHub Actions
